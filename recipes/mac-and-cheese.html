        <p>Macaroni and Cheese is the original American comfort food. You can't go wrong with cheese and noodles.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices canned jalapeno peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>3 dashes hot sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>            
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Melt 1/4 cup butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Stir flour into melted butter and cook until smooth and bubbling, about 1 minute. Mix milk, cream cheese, jalapeno peppers, Dijon mustard, black pepper, and salt into flour-butter mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Mix macaroni and Cheddar cheese into sauce; pour into a 2-quart casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons butter, and parsley together in a bowl; spread over macaroni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
